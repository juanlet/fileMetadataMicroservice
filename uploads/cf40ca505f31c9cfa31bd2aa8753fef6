I'm using Picasso library to download images from URL. This is my first attempt on Picasso

Scenario : I want to download some images from server and store them into a file. I know how to store into file and retrieve. When I ran the below code, I happen to see that I'm getting only last image. It seems like Picasso runs parallelly. I checked it by displaying a toast message. Is there anyway to solve this issue?

Problem : I'm getting only the last url image.

Here's my code

static int  count = 0;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    for (int i = 0; i < url.length; i++)
    {

        // url is String array which has 2 urls. 
        ++count;   // Incrementing the count by 1
        Picasso.with(this).load(url[i])
        .into(new Target() {

            @Override
            public void onPrepareLoad(Drawable arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

            }

            @Override
            public void onBitmapLoaded(Bitmap arg0, LoadedFrom arg1) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                arg0 = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(arg0, 150, 150, true);
                filePath = saveFile(arg0);   // I'm just calling this function to check how many times `onBitmapLoaded` is called. And it is called only once...!!
            }

            @Override
            public void onBitmapFailed(Drawable arg0) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub

            }
        });
    }
}

public String saveFile (Bitmap bm)
{

   Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), ""+count, 100).show(); // Displaying the value of count, which always display as **2**. 
   return "";
}

Yes it always show count 2 becz when your first image bitmap loaded at time count has reached value 2 in iteration. – Haresh Chhelana Jul 18 '14 at 10:18
